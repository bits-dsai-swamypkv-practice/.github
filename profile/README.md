# BITS Pilani Digital | M.Sc. Data Science & AI – Applied Practice

This organization hosts applied coursework, laboratories, experiments, and capstone projects developed as part of the **M.Sc. Data Science & Artificial Intelligence** program at **BITS Pilani Digital**.

The repositories span **six trimesters** and reflect a structured, hands-on learning journey across statistics, mathematics, machine learning, deep learning, data engineering, and applied AI systems.

## Structure of This Organization

Repositories are organized by **trimester and subject** for academic clarity and traceability.

### Trimester Repositories
- `t1-*` → Foundations (Probability, Statistics, Linear Algebra, Python)
- `t2-*` → Inferential Statistics, ML Foundations, Data Engineering
- `t3-*` → Supervised & Unsupervised Learning
- `t4-*` → Deep Learning, NLP, Computer Vision
- `t5-*` → Advanced ML, Research Methods, Electives
- `t6-*` → Capstone Project

### Supporting Repositories
- `lab-*` → Exploratory experiments and side studies
- `lib-*` → Reusable utilities and shared components
- `capstone-*` → Final applied project(s)

## Repository Standards

Each repository follows a consistent structure:

```

README.md        → Overview and learning objectives
syllabus.md      → Course/module mapping
notes/           → Conceptual notes
notebooks/       → Jupyter notebooks
assignments/     → Coursework and solutions
experiments/     → Exploratory work
datasets/        → Small, reproducible datasets
references/      → Papers, books, and links
reports/         → Summaries and findings

```

## Visibility & Maturity

- Early-trimester repositories may contain **learning-stage work**
- Selected repositories will be made **public** as they mature
- Capstone repositories represent **production-quality outcomes**

---

## Disclaimer

This organization is intended for **academic learning and applied practice**.  
Not all repositories reflect final or polished implementations.
